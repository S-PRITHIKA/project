🌿 Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

This project is an AI-powered Plant Disease Detection System that identifies diseases from plant leaf images using a deep learning model.
It helps farmers, students, researchers, and gardeners detect diseases early and take preventive action.

  Features

* Upload leaf images for instant disease prediction
* Predicts disease name + confidence score
* User-friendly Streamlit web app
* Separate training script to retrain with any dataset
* Supports multiple plant species & disease types
* Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
* Works offline once model is trained

  Tech Stack

Backend & AI

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy
* OpenCV
* Matplotlib

Frontend / UI

* Streamlit
* HTML templates (optional for Flask)

Storage

* JSON (class labels)

  How It Works

1. User uploads an image of a plant leaf
2. Image is preprocessed 
3. Model predicts disease class
4. Outputs:

   * Disease name
   * Confidence percentage


  How to Run the Project

1) Install dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2) Run Streamlit Web App

```sh
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

3) Run Flask App 

```sh
python app.py
```

  Dataset

* Includes multiple plant species
* Contains healthy and diseased leaf images
* Preprocessed and augmented for better accuracy
* Compatible with PlantVillage dataset format


  Future Improvements

* Add voice-based disease description
* Provide real-time prevention suggestions
* Deploy model using FastAPI + Docker
* Mobile app support using Flutter
